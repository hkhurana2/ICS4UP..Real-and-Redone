/**
 * This class has  3 binary searches, one for integers, one for doubles, and one for strings
 * The way binary search works is that it looks at the target value and then compares it to the middle valus of the array.
 * If the targt value is greater than the middle value, the whole array is split into the second halof for searching.
 * If the target values is lass than the middle value, the whole array is split into the first half for searching
 * The same process keeps on going until the target value is found in the array. 
 * If the value is found in the array, the index number of where the target was found is returned.
 * If the target value is not found, then -1 is returned
